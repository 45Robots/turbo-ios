# Demo

Open `Demo.xcworkspace` and run the `Demo` app target. By default, the demo app loads a remotely hosted Turbo demo app. You can also clone that demo app to experiment from [https://github.com/basecamp/turbo-native-demo](https://github.com/basecamp/turbo-native-demo), and then you just need to change `Demo.current` to use `local` in `Demo/Demo.swift`. Then it will use the local version of the demo.
